WRF-PUCM-PF is a fully-coupled atmosphere-land surface-subsurface 
model developed for urban areas. It is built by coupling WRF-PUCM 
(Li & Bou-Zeid, 2013, 2014; Wang, Bou-Zeid, & Smith, 2013) and 
ParFlow (Ashby and Falgout, 1996; Jones and Woodward, 2001; 
Maxwell, 2013; Kollet and Maxwell, 2006). To couple the two code, 
the approach developed and introduced by Maxwell et al. (2011) was 
utilized. 

WRF-PUCM is based on WRF-3.5.0. Most versions of ParFlow could be 
used to couple to ParFlow. ParFlow 3.3.1 to 3.6.0 have been 
successfully coupled to ParFlow.
